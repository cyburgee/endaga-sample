Key:
</h3>
<p>
Bars drawn on the map represent the signal strength at that location at a certain time. Use the time slider at the top to view how the cellular reception changes over time. The map is updated every 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
The height of the bars indicates the quality of the reception at that location and time. The color of the bars also classifies the bars in terms of good, fair, and bad quality by assigning them the colors green, yellow, and red respectively. Bad quality is a rssi of -100 dBm and lower, fair is a rssi between -80 dBm and -100 dBm, and good quality is a rssi of -80 dBm and higher.
